Advanced Custom Fields plugin to allow for dynamic choices (through SQL queries)

== Description ==

If you've ever needed your ACF choices to be dynamically generated by a SQL query, this plugin will help you get the job done.

You can mix and match static choices with dynamic, SQL-based choices by placing as many regular choices in the list as you'd like, followed by the special `%%QUERY%%` choice that will tell this plugin to load choices dynamically from the database.

An example on how to list users, setting the `id` as the value, would look like this:

`%%QUERY%% : SELECT user_nicename AS text, id AS value FROM wp_users`
 

== Installation ==

1. Upload `acf-dynamic-choices` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. Alternatively, install the `zip` through the WordPress Plugins installer.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Place a query in your ACF choices box in this form: `%%QUERY%% : SELECT field1 AS text, field2 AS value FROM ....`
1. Browse to a Post or the Options Page where you just added the dynamic query and ensure that the choices are properly being populated.
